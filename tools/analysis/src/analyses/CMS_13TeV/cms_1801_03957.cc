  // Here is a couple of useful functions and lines:  
  //------------Phase Space Cuts (defined for jets, electronsXYZ, muonsXYZ, photonsXYZ)
  // jets = filterPhaseSpace(jets, 20., -2.8, 2.8)  // The vector 'jets' only contains jets with pt >= 20 GeV and -2.8 < eta < 2.8. This function is applicable to other particles too (electronsMedium, ... ).
  // jets = overlapRemoval(jets, electronsLoose, 0.2) Removes all jets for which there exists any electron in 'electronsLoose' with deltaR < 0.2.
  // jets = overlapRemovel(jets, 0.2) If two jets overlap within deltaR < 0.2, only the harder jet is stored.
  
  //------------Isolation Checks (defined for electronsXYZ, muonsXYZ, photonsXYZ
  //------------        For each object, if the user entered N isolation conditions, they can be
  //------------        checked individually be the second argument (running from 0 to N-1).
  // electronsMedium = filterIsolation(electronsMedium, 0)            Removes electrons that do not pass the first isolation condition entered into the AnalysisManager by the user
  // std::vector<int> flags; flags.push_back(0); flags.push_back(2);
  // electronsMedium = filterIsolation(electronsMedium, flags)        Same as above, but both the first and the third condition have to be fulfilled
  // electronsMedium = filterIsolation(electronsMedium)               Same as above, but all conditions have to be fulfilled.
  
  //-----------Flavour Tag Checks (defined for jets only)
  //----------          Tau tags "loose", "medium" or "tight" can be individually checked if the user enabled tau tagging in the AM.
  //----------          For b-tags, if N working points have been defined, the ith condition can be tested by putting i-1 into the second argument (if there is only one, the argument can be omitted)
  // if checkTauTag(jets[0], "tight") leadingJetIsTagged = True;
  // if checkBTag(jets[0], 0) leadingJetIsBTagged = True;


  //-----------Auxiliary Information
  // - Always ensure that you don't access vectors out of bounds. E.g. 'if(jets[1]->PT > 150)' should rather be if (jets.size() > 1 && jets[1]->PT > 150). 
  // - Use rand()/(RAND_MAX+1.) for random numbers between 0 and 1. The random seed is determined from system time or by the RandomSeed parameter in CheckMATE.
  // - The 'return' statement will end this function for the current event and hence should be called whenever the current event is to be vetoed.
  // - Many advanced kinematical functions like mT2 are implemented. Check the manual for more information.
  // - If you need output to be stored in other files than the cutflow/signal files we provide, check the manual for how to do this conveniently.  

  missingET->addMuons(muonsCombined);  // Adds muons to missing ET. This should almost always be done which is why this line is not commented out.
